        <h2>Who They Are</h2>
        <p>Anonymous is a decentralized international hacktivist collective and movement primarily recognized for its various cyber operations against governments, government institutions, corporations, and organizations they accuse of censorship, corruption, or human rights violations.</p>
        <p>The group originated in 2003 on the imageboard 4chan, specifically in the /b/ board, emerging from the site's culture of anonymity. The name "Anonymous" refers to the absence of individual identification, with members operating under the collective identity rather than personal recognition. The group has no consistent leadership or membership structure, making it a truly decentralized entity that anyone can claim affiliation with by simply adopting its symbols and methods.</p>
        <p>They are widely recognized by their use of the Guy Fawkes mask as their primary symbol, which was popularized by the graphic novel and 2005 film adaptation of "V for Vendetta." This symbol has since become associated with anti-establishment and anti-authority movements worldwide.</p>
